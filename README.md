# Flatiron School Module 1 Final Project

Team Member: Miri Guo

## Introduction

For this project, I analyzed movies released between 2010 through present. I collected over 15,000 releases for this time period including data on genre(s), ratings, run time, actors, place of distribution, budget and revenue. I used a variety of data sources, credited below.


## Project Goals

My goal is to answer the following questions through data collection and analysis:

1. Is the industry growing?
2. What is the competitive landscape?
3. What movies should I make?
4. When should I release the movies?
5. How much money should I invest?
6. How can I can measure 'hype/buzz'
6. Further Analysis
	- Amazon Prime
	- Netflix
	- Youtube
	- Disney+
	- Hulu

## Recommendation:
1. Is the industry growing? Yes, but lots of hits and misses.
2. What is the competitive landscape? Top studios create blockbuster hits leaving room for smaller studios to create indie films and documentaries.
3. What movies should I make? Depends on my budget, but actions movies perform the best at the box office.
4. When should I release the movies? Summer, and then December.
5. How much money should I invest? $500M
6. How can I can measure 'hype/buzz': Twitter API 
7. Further Analysis: See slides!
