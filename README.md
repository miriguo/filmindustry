# Flatiron School Module 1 Final Project

Team Members: Miri Guo

## Introduction

For this project, I analyzed movies released between 2010 through present. I collected over 15,000 releases for this time period including data on genre(s), ratings, run time, actors, place of distribution, budget and revenue. I used a variety of data sources, credited below.


## Project Goals

My goal is to answer the following questions through data collection and analysis:

1. Is the industry growing?
2. What is the competitive landscape?
3. What movies should I make?
	- Genre?
	- Runtime?
	- Team? 
4. When, where and how should I distribute my movies?
	- Amazon Prime
	- Netflix
	- Youtube
	- Disney+
	- Hulu
5. How much money should I invest?
